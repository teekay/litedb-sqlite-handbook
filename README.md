This is an accompaniment to my LiteDB-SQLite handbook.

I extracted it from a private repo hosting Bewitched, my Windows app for DJs of tango, salsa, and other social dances. That explains why there's so much code and clutter that is irrelevant to the topics covered in the handbook.

The **MusicLibrary.Cli** project contains the code for the console app that you can use to run various tests of the LiteDB implementation of the **MusicLibrary** persistence contracts, which you will find in the **MusicLibrary.Persistence.LiteDb** project.
